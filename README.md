# Wire View PCAP Analyzer

Wire View is a C/C++ program that analyzes pcap files generated by tools like tcpdump and Wireshark. It provides insights into the captured packets, including details about Ethernet, IP, UDP, and ARP headers. The program calculates statistics such as start date and time, duration, total number of packets, unique senders and receivers, ARP participants, unique UDP source and destination ports, and packet size information.

## Features

- Parse pcap files and analyze packet headers (Ethernet, IP, UDP, ARP).
- Calculate and print statistics for each packet.
- Generate aggregate information such as unique senders, receivers, ARP participants, and UDP ports.
- Report average, minimum, and maximum packet sizes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C/C++ compiler (gcc/g++)
- libpcap library
- Linux environment (tested on Ubuntu 20.04)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/argrabowski/wire-view-pcap-analyzer.git
    cd wire-view
    ```

2. Build the executable:

    ```bash
    make all
    ```

## Usage

Run the program with a pcap file as an argument:

```bash
./wireview <pcap_file>
```

Replace `<pcap_file>` with the path to the pcap file you want to analyze.
